# Skills Group 1
# Use a function that accepts multiple parameters

# Return a result value

# This function calculates the number of days in a variable number of
# years, months, and days. These variables are provided by the user and
# are passed to the function through the functionâ€™s parameters.
def find_total_days(years, months, days):
    # Assign a variable to hold the calculations for the number of days in
    # a year (years*365) plus the number of days in a month (months*30) plus
    # the number of days provided through the "days" parameter variable.
    my_days = (years * 365) + (months * 30) + days
    # Use the "return" keyword to send the result of the "my_days"
    # calculation to the function call.
    return my_days


# Function call with user provided parameter values.
print(find_total_days(2, 5, 23))



# Skill Group 2
#
# Use a function to return the result of a measurement conversion
#
# Use arithmetic operators to perform a calculation
#
# Combine text with a function call within a print() statement
#
# Convert the return value from a float data type to a string for the print() function
#
# Call the function and perform a calculation on the return value within a print() statement

# This function converts fluid ounces to milliliters and returns the
# result of the conversion.
def convert_volume(fluid_ounce):
    # Calculate value of the "ml" variable using the parameter variable
    # "fluid_ounce". There are approximately 29.5 milliliters in 1 fluid
    # ounce.
    ml = fluid_ounce * 29.5
    # Return the result of the calculation.
    return ml


# Call the conversion from within the print() function using 2 fluid
# ounces. Convert the return value from a float to a string.
print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(2)))

# Call the function again and double the 2 fluid ounces from within
# the print function.
print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(2) * 2))
# Alternative calculation:
# print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(4))
