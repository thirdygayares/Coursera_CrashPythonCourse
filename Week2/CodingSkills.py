# Skills Group 1
# The following lines assign the variable to the left of the =
# assignment operator with the values and arithmetic expressions
# on the right side of the = assignment operator.
hotel_room = 100
tax = hotel_room * 0.08
total = hotel_room + tax
room_guests = 4
share_per_person = total / room_guests

# This line outputs the result of the final calculation stored
# in the variable "share_per_person"
print("Each person needs to pay: " + str(share_per_person))  # change a data type

# Skills Group 2
# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."

print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix)
# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.

# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name, ",", suffix)
# However, you will find that this produces a space before a comma within a string.

# skills Group 3
# Resolve TypeError caused by a data type mismatch issue
# Use an explicit conversion function

# print("5 * 3 = " + (5 * 3))

# Resolution:
#print("5 * 3 = " + str(5*3))
#
# To avoid a type error between the string and the integer within the
# print() function, you can make an explicit data type conversion by
# using the str() function to convert the integer to a string.


# skill group 4
#Resolve a ZeroDivisionError caused by an attempt to divide by 0

numerator = 7
denominator = 0  # Possible resolution: Change the denominator value
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)

# One possible assumption for a number divided by zero error might
# include the issue of a null value as a denominator (could happen when
# using a loop to iterate over values in a database). In such cases, the
# desired outcome may be to leave the numerator value intact. The
# numerator value can be preserved by reassigning the denominator with
# the integer value of 1. The result would then equal the numerator.
